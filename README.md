# huh?

I created this app because I often wanted to continue reading research papers during my commute, but couldn't as I walk everywhere. So, I made a simple solution: paste text into the field, and have it read aloud while I walk. It's just a proof of concept for now, but it serves its purpose. I hope others find it useful too.


<br />

This project contains an HTML file named `index.html`, which implements a simple web application. The app allows users to input text into a textarea and have it read out loud using speech synthesis. Users can also clear the text input, stop the speech, and resume speech playback.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the web page is defined using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are utilized for styling the appearance of the web page elements.
- **JavaScript**: The functionality of the Speak app is implemented using JavaScript. It handles user interactions, text processing, and speech synthesis.

## Key Features

- **Speech Synthesis**: Utilizes the Web Speech API for converting text input into audible speech.
- **Text Processing**: Various text processing functions are implemented to modify the input text before speech synthesis, including removing reference citations, adding section breaks, and restoring split words.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the app by inputting text, initiating speech playback, pausing, resuming, and clearing the text.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Input text into the textarea provided.
3. Click the "Speak" button to have the text read aloud.
4. Use the "Pause" button to pause speech playback.
5. Use the "Resume" button to resume speech playback.
6. Click the "Clear" button to clear the text input.
